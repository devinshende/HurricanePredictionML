# Hurricane Satellite Imagery Damage Detection
Fork of repository Deep Learning Based Damage Detection on Post-Hurricane Satellite Imagery
We added additional data to try and improve detection from kaggle competition

* The dataset: 
  1. train_another     : the training data; 5000 images of each class
  2. validation_another: the validation data; 1000 images of each class
  3. test_another      : the unbalanced test data; 8000/1000 images of damaged/undamaged classes
  4. test              : the balanced test data; 1000 images of each class
